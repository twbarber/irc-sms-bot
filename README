There are 2 files that need to be created for testbot.py to run...

    server
    nums

Currently uses config file 'server' in irc-sms-bot directory to 
configure server. Format is as follows:

    Server.Address
    PortNumber
    gmail_account@gmail.com
    PlainTextGmailPassword
    
    Example:
    
        mywebsite.com
        6667
        testemail@gmail.com
        hunter2
    
The numbers you wish to text are also stored as plain text in a file called
'nums' in the irc-sms-bot directory as follows:

    Number1
    Number2
    Number3
    
    Example: 
    
        8005551234  
        1234567891  
        1231231234
      
TODO:
    
    - Put delay between sent messages to not flood GVoice
    - Catch blatant spamming of messages in IRC
    - Improve overall stability
